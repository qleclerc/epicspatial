\title{Calculates the distance matrix}
\usage{
calc_dist_mat(spatial_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{spatial_data}{The spatial dataset to use to calculate the distance matrix.}
}
\value{
Returns one matrix object containing the distances between all populated areas.
}
\description{
Calculates the distance between all populated areas in the spatial dataset.
}
\details{
This function calculates the distance matrix once to avoid doing it for every generation during an
         epidemic simulation. This is essential to later speed up the epidemic simulation. The matrix returned
         only contains distance between cells with non-NA values (i.e. cells with people in them). Note that this
         function assumes that the distances are in meters in the dataset! If that is not the case, you might want
         to either convert these, or adjust the output of this function.

\examples{

#Create a spatial dataset:
test_data = raster::raster(nrow=10, ncol=10, xmn=1, xmx=100000, ymn=1, ymx=100000)
values(test_data) = runif(100, 1, 1000)

dist_mat = calc_dist_mat(test_data)
